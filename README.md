# englo

Englo project is composed by *two* parts:

* **englo-portal** ~ the demo portal with everything installed 
* **englo-entando-components** ~ this is the fork of the components project with the newly created plugin, ready to be merged back in GitHub

#Installation

* install the Entando **core** v4.2-TP1 from [this page](https://github.com/entando/entando-core)
* from the **components** folder install everything with the following command **mvn install -DskipTests**

Upon completion the **englo-entando-englo-portal** portal can be run using either Tomcat or Jetty.
